# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This is a project done for UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp in which I utilized the [@Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) CSS framework to create a mock-up of my own web developer portfolio. Using an identical structure to my [Basic-Portfolio](http://baang.github.io/Basic-Portfolio) project, this assignment was done to showcase the ability to create the same design more efficiently and intuitively by utilizing the [@Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) grid among other components and technologies that it makes more readily usable and available.

## Technologies Used
* Git
* HTML
* CSS
* [@Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) CSS
* [@Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) Javascript
